# Learning_HBase_Java
A small boilerplate java application using the Hbase Java API. I wrote it while tinkering to learn a bit of Java.

The app only tries to connect to HBase and then check if a 'test' table exists. Since it only a single file, the code will need to be compiled on an edge node using `javac` and including the classpath to the resources.
